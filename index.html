            <h2>Chicken</h2><p>I’m sitting on the bank of the Chao Phraya, digging into a slimy plastic bag of fall-off-the-chopped-bone grilled chicken with sticky rice, which I bought at a little street stall just upriver from Bangkok. It’s a one-person feast. I devour the meat, one bite at a time, as I roll the rice into little balls between my fingers, dipping it into super-spicy nam prik. I sop up the sauce and revel in the sweet-tangy heat of the whole affair (undoubtedly enhanced by MSG). My mouth tingles, my fingers glisten with grease. I sweat in my seat on this riverside pier, the air 90 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale, the chile many multitudes higher on the Scoville scale. All around me, people dig into little plastic bags of their own. I briefly wonder how many others are having unique little chicken epiphanies this same afternoon.

            As a species, we humans love chicken. As a meat, it surpasses all others in the number of animals raised for consumption. It’s the most plentiful bird in the world, and we’ve made it so: more than 19 billion worldwide, which equates to an average of nearly three chickens per person on Earth (or nearly 40 for every person in Bahrain and Brunei, the biggest chicken lovers on the planet). Those numbers are rising, with poultry as the world’s leading livestock industry.
            
            Why such ardor for a bird? Well, it tastes like chicken. But it’s also cheap — chickens are quicker and easier to raise than cattle, pigs or goats. And unlike other creatures of the human dining repertoire, few cultures maintain chicken taboos.But our chicken addiction has led human beings into a thicket of trouble. The more we eat, the more we produce, the more we wrestle with our conscience about what we do to animals in order to consume them — practices that may threaten our very survival as human beings. The human-chicken story is one of love, evolution and risk.

            The typical chicken we eat is a descendent of the “aggressive, pugnacious” red jungle fowl of Asia, writes Harold McGee, the godfather of food science. It was Gallus gallus, a member of the pheasant family, which eventually morphed into the breast on our plates today. “Chickens seem to have been domesticated in the vicinity of Thailand before 7500 BCE, and arrived in the Mediterranean around 500 BCE,” he writes. Fitting, then, that Thailand today serves such finger-licking luscious little bits of bird. In the West, it wasn’t until the 19th century when imported Chinese fowl sparked a frenzy of bird breeding, turning the “unpampered farmyard scavengers” of the day into the meat we Americans now love. We humans have tamed the wild and pugnacious into a feathered food machine.
